! YAML - ain't markup language

Not going into the depth, YAML is a synchronization language like XML and JSON which is used to store data in code format which then can be converted into 
a form which can be used by any program.

The tools for YAML are

## Datree - preventing misconfigurations of kubernetes (A YAML verifier kinda)
## Lens - generates the manifests in yaml.
